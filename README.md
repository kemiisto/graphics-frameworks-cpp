# Developing Graphics Frameworks with C++ and OpenGL

Examples from [Developing Graphics Frameworks with Java and OpenGL](https://www.routledge.com/Developing-Graphics-Frameworks-with-Java-and-OpenGL/Stemkoski-Cona/p/book/9780367720698) by Lee Stemkoski, James Cona written in C++.

- Original Java code that uses LWJGL could be found [here](https://github.com/stemkoski/Graphics-Framework-Java).
- C++ version of examples presented here uses GLEW and GLFW3.
- A tiny self-made object-oriented OpenGL framework is closer to procedural OpenGL than one developed in Java by the authors.
